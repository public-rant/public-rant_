## Hi there!

I enjoy exercising critical thinking by [translating information](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/4-313-advanced-studio-on-the-production-of-space-fall-2016/pages/assignments/modeling-experiment-ii/) from one medium to another.

### Think outside the box

OpenAI's [Lunar Landar](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/box2d/lunar_lander.py#L726-L777) is a good starting point. Further scaffolding found [here](https://github.com/stefan-jansen/machine-learning-for-trading/blob/main/22_deep_reinforcement_learning/04_q_learning_for_trading.ipynb).

Once the basics are in place, more robust predictions can be made through [advanced modelling](https://github.com/orgs/QuantEcon/repositories?q=lecture+notebooks&type=all&language=&sort=)

### Language Games

Work has been done to [develop a syntax for describing bouldering problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.0532). [Custom parsers](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) can be built to enable developers to design real world environments using text. Microsoft's [language-server-protocol](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/language-server-extension-guide) is a mature framework for IDE integration. Further [examples](#lsp-examples) are described below

### Infrastructure

> But, say you, surely there is nothing easier than for me to imagine trees, for instance, in a park, or books existing in a closet, and nobody by to perceive them.

Provision infrastructure with `terraform`, bearing in mind [OWASP](https://owasp.org/) using Google's [Cloud Armour](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/click-to-deploy-solutions/tree/12c0a71185a6f85960308ec7c2e2499afc99e699/cloud-armor-demo) or [AWS Shield](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/shield_protection)

Reduce overhead by [using `gpg` to manage `ssh`](https://ryanlue.com/posts/2017-06-29-gpg-for-ssh-auth)

Stay safe by using `restic` the [fast, efficient, and secure](https://github.com/restic) backup program.

### Deliverables

- [Enmergent tool use](https://openai.com/research/emergent-tool-use)
- [Re-implement out-of-date examples](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-171-software-engineering-for-web-applications-fall-2003/)
- [3D Printed bouldering holds](https://www.samsaraeco.com/)
- [Guard against anti patterns in Web Framworks](https://github.com/immer/playlists)
- [Design and process custom protocols](https://github.com/public-rant/followermaze)
